Real-time installation/infographic for the PIME of Milan. The installation tells the story of the Foundation through its numbers, in a continuous particles flow that recalls the movement of the sea.

Developed with Threejs and glsl/gpgpu shader for particles computation.
A little python backend retrieves data from a rest api.
